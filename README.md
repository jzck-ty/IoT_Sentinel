# Implementing IoT Sentinel: Automated Device-Type Identification for Security Enforcement in IoT

M. Miettinen et al presented IoT SENTINEL project which applies an automated device-type identification for security enforcement in IoT networks. This system identifies the device types connected to a network and applies some security 
policies to mitigate the effect of vulnerable devices over the network. IoT SENTINEL controls the traffic flows of 
vulnerable devices in order to protect other devices in the network from threats and prevent data leakage. In this project, 
we implemented two different distance discrimination models based on provided algorithm in IoT SENTINEL project and compared them, then we applied a Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier to compare our result with previous implemented Random Forest Classifier. Finally, we used a data preprocessing methode to raw input data and achieved a significant result in our classifiers' accuracy.
